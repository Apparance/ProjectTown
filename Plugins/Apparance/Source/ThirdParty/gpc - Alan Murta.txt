Hi Sam
You may use GPC commercially for no charge. GPC is no longer a University of Manchester thing, and is no longer available for new users. So there are no licensing issues.
For your attribution information please just attribute Alan Murta and make no mention of the University.
If you have any queries please let me know.
Best wishes
