# ProjectTown

Toy town is a small test project to showcase some of the new interaction and editing features we’ve been refining over the past year in Apparance. We started with a simple, quality asset pack from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/) and made a tiny city builder. Place trees, suburbs, city blocks and skyscrapers and fettle with their parameters to build out your own tiny town.  Hit up festive mode and bring some procedural Christmas vibes to your creation.

Toy town is built using the Unreal version of [Apparance](https://apparance.uk/index.htm) which has a completely [free demo version](https://apparance.itch.io/apparance-demo-plugin-unreal).

## Setup

A [pre-built version](https://apparance.itch.io/the-apparance-town-toy) is available to play with on itch.io if you'd rather just try it straight away.

The project is currently set up to work with Unreal Engine 5.3.  It has a custom build of the Apparance Plugin included (to support the new handles and interaction features under development that it is designed to showcase).

> ⚠ If you own the plugin already, you will need to remove it from your UE 5.3 install location to avoid clashes. e.g. Move the `\Engine\Plugins\Procedural\ApparanceUnreal` folder out to somewhere safe until you need it again.
