* UE 5.4 support
* Blueprint support for List parameters (via structs/arrays)
* Improved Blueprint function categorisation
* Rotate operator added to UV mapping support
* Minor instanced mesh crash fixes

---- Info:11/10/2023 - Version 1.2.11
* Replace missing Polygon and PolygonExtrude operators (new Shape based inputs)
* Fix editor install/launch issue
* Fix minor shutdown crash

---- Info:29/9/2023 - Version 1.2.10
* UE 5.3 support
* Better 2D shape/hole support (with Combine, Area Filter, Frame Filter, Make shape ops)
* Fix crash playing standalone from in-editor

---- Info:17/5/2023 - Version 1.2.9
* UE 5.2 support
* Fix editor note persistance in many locales

---- Info:1/3/2023 - Version 1.2.8
* Vector input box interactive drag sometimes wasn't updating the view
* Copy/paste wasn't working in some languages
* Corrected character display in details panel (e.g. parameter names) for some languages
* General plugin hardening (from prototype work)
* Instanced mesh update optimisation
* Improved mobility management
* Instanced mesh navigation control
* Blueprint parameter access fixes
* Blueprint Busy flag and timeslice control
* Blueprint float inputs now connect to standard double types properly (UE5 only)
* RebuildApparanceEntity node Target input has default [self] behaviour so you don't have to add a self node (UE5 only)
* RebuildApparanceEntity node was sometimes showing really long input node names when selecting procedure type.
* Autoselected procedure type now reflected immediately on node inputs.
* Content timeslicing and generation counters
* Smoother/faster operation under heavy placement load
* Plugin shutdown tidy and crash fix

---- Info:18/1/2023 - Version 1.2.7
* Internal version only, not released

---- Info:24/11/2022 - Version 1.2.6
* Fix ArcTan operator (which was actually calculating ArcCos) :/
* Invert operator for flipping geometry side (e.g. if you want the inside of extruded shape)
* Complex collision mesh generation support (material flag)
* Fix incorrect slider default for RotateVDeg input
* Allow project to force use of instanced rendering, and allow per-mesh use of instanced rendering
* General Unreal 5.1 build compatibility fixes
* Remove use of RerunConstructionScripts in non-editor builds
* Fix blueprint placement in cooked builds (persist BP generated class, not the blueprint itself)
* For custom builds that support it we can fix UV distortion issues on long/thin polys by switching UPMC to high precision UVs
* Translate/Rotate/Scale/Move geometry operators now transform placed objects too
* Copy operator (same semantics as Move, but copies, including objects)
* Performance optims: Disable overlap update during component creation/setup. Don't create proc geom/collision components if not needed (also warning spam)
* Standalone startup crash fix
* Entity optimisations: All rebuilds now deferred to properly coalesce build requests
* Entity improvements: ProcMeshComponent for geometry and collision only created if needed (WIP)
* List opertors: Reverse, and path (Vector3 list) length
* Vector normalise operator
* Allow instanced meshes to affect navigation
* Standalone cook fixes
EXPERIMENTAL/WORK IN PROGRESS:
* Image operators (can be used to modify bulk frame operations and other gen operators)
* Spline/path/shape composition operators (line/point, arc, ellipse, rect, bezier)
* Loft operator (basic geometry from shape moved along path)
* Height Map operator to apply image value as mesh vertex offsets
* Warp frames - Map frames from XY to two paths
* New bulk frame operators: Grid, Resolve, Place, Offset, Turn, Resize, Cull.
* New 'frame on a path' operator
* Polygon vertex validation checks (inf/nan/den checked for and fail poly op)
* Data operator file slots (to read multiple sources simultaneously)
* Noise warp affects objects too

---- Info:23/3/2022 - Version 1.2.3
* Procedure category and name validation prevent invalid filename crash
* Fixed broken/crashing input metadata editing when single input selected
* Speculative fix for missing UI elements on some machines/locales
* Input metadata controls (e.g. on Frame) now wrap to avoid being cut off
* Fix generation breakage when rearranging procedure outputs
* Fix to stop parameter values in Presets always being overridded by defaults
